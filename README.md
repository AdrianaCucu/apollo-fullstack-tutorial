### Built to familiarise myself with Apollo and GraphQL in the context of a React application by following the tutorial at [www.apollographql.com](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction) ðŸš€

#

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd start/server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```bash
cd start/client && npm i && npm start
```
